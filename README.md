Our project is based on a Blood Bank Donation System Database. A Blood Bank stores blood of
various blood groups . Many donors donate blood ,each of different blood group/type. A donor
may donate blood more than once and he is identified by a donor id(DID),name, sex, age ,
address and phone number. The blood donated by the donor is characterized by blood type ,
code and cost. Before each donor donates his blood , he is required to register himself as a donor
with the receptionist who works at the Blood Bank. The receptionist is identified by employee id,
name , address and phone number. The Blood Banks receives orders for blood from many
hospitals for emergency purposes and other surgical requirements and each blood bank issues
the same of required blood type. Each blood bank has it’s own blood bank number(BNO) ,
issues, orders and blood types stored. The Blood Bank is managed by the blood bank manager
who is identified by employee id , name , email_id and phone number .He is responsible for the
proper management of the blood bank . The hospitals are identified by name, address and
phone number.
